# Introduction

##Stock market predictor
Our website allows anyone to choose a stock, machine learning model, and time period. Using our own model and already existing data, we will return our prediction of where the stock will be after the given time period along with other statistics.

While there are many other programs that try to predict the stock market, ours is different in that it is a lot more accessible. We provide enough statistics to be helpful without overwhelming the user with unnecessary information. We also offer a variety of models to use and give an estimate of how accurate each model is.
